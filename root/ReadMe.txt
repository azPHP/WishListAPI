This is the "root" of the AzPHP "WishList" Group Project.

From this initial version, there will be two branches representing the two frameworks we have agreed to work on:  Yii and Kohana.

The future is unknowable, but I predict that each of us will have their own branch on this project, possibly with their own framework of choice.  Other frameworks were mentioned in discussions:  Zend Framework, Lithium, CakePHP.

I don't know how the sub-directories are going to layout, but so far, I know this:

ROOT:  contains this file and any files agreed upon by the group, at large.

YiiPath:  this is where the initial creation of the Yii Framework lives.
(Note:  I didn't create this name, the framework did.)
